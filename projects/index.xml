      <title>MIT Spokes Speaker Kits</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past summer I had the privelege to bike across the country with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mitspokes.com/&#34;&gt;MIT Spokes&lt;/a&gt;. It was a 74-day student-led trip, starting in Washington, D.C., and ending in San Francisco. Along the way, we stopped at schools, libraries, camps, and even a correctional facility to teach STEM topics based on our personal interests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When planning my lesson, I knew I wanted it to be as hands-on as possible. I decided to teach about the physics of sound by having each student build their own speaker. From there, I had the task of manufacturing 200 speaker kits for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reciept Poetry Printing Robot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote this down first because this is a project that I have been working on recently. My friend from Yale really likes poetry, and once I started playing with thermal printers, he got the idea to print poems with them. I thought that this was a great idea and immediately hopped into onshape. I designed a sheet metal enclosure for it with a 3D printed sign on top encouraging users to press the big red button. You can check out the Onshape cad &lt;a href=&#34;https://cad.onshape.com/documents/cf3778deca11ee0736d88359/w/80c19d9216b3187a060b21ef/e/34e68baa4d9532f38bcb4871?renderMode=0&amp;amp;uiState=66f1c5994927d10f4adc73d7&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
